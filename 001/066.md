# Vulnerability in createPair Function Allows Creation of Unusable Pools

## Summary
A function createPair used to create pairs of ERC20 tokens and WETH (Wrapped Ether) in a decentralized exchange. It checks the parameters provided in GoatTypes.InitParams struct for non-zero values but lacks a minimum threshold check, potentially allowing attackers to create unusable pools with very low parameter values.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the lack of a minimum value check for the parameters virtualEth, bootstrapEth, and initialTokenMatch in the createPair function. This could enable attackers to create pools with values that render them unusable for trading, impacting the liquidity and functionality of the decentralized exchange.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to the creation of pools that are not viable for trading, affecting the exchange's liquidity and usability. Such pools may disrupt trading activities and potentially harm the overall user experience on the exchange platform.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L35

```javascript
    function createPair(address token, GoatTypes.InitParams memory params) external returns (address) {
        // @note is there a need to have minimum values for theser params so it can't be frontrun?
        if (params.bootstrapEth == 0 || params.virtualEth == 0 || params.initialTokenMatch == 0) {
            revert GoatErrors.InvalidParams();
        }
        if (pools[token] != address(0)) {
            revert GoatErrors.PairExists();
        }
        if (token == weth) {
            revert GoatErrors.CannnotPairWithBaseAsset();
        }
        GoatV1Pair pair = new GoatV1Pair();
        pair.initialize(token, weth, baseName, params);
        pools[token] = address(pair);
        emit PairCreated(token, weth, address(pair));
        return address(pair);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a minimum threshold check for the parameters virtualEth, bootstrapEth, and initialTokenMatch to ensure that pools created have sufficient liquidity for trading. By enforcing minimum values for these parameters, the protocol can mitigate the risk of attackers creating unusable pools
