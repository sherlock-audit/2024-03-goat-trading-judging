# Mitigation Required for Fee-on-Transfer Vulnerability in Swap Function

## Summary
The swap function of the contract is vulnerable to malicious tokens implementing high fee-on-transfer mechanisms.  The lack of balance checks before and after token transfers could lead to the contract's token reserves being drained or unexpected changes disrupting the internal accounting of the AMM.
## Vulnerability Detail
* The `swap` function transfers tokens to the specified `to` address using `IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(to, amountTokenOut)`.
* No checks are performed to verify the expected token balance within the contract before and after this transfer.
* This allows tokens with `fee-on-transfer` mechanics to unexpectedly reduce the amount received by the `to` address while still altering the contract's internal state as if the full amount had been transferred.
## Impact
 An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a token with a high transfer fee (e.g., 99%) to drain a significant portion of the contract's tokens.Even with smaller transfer fees, the contract's reserve calculations and other accounting logic will be thrown off.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Introduce checks to compare the token balance of the contract before and after the `safeTransfer` calls. Ensure that the difference between the two balances matches the intended `amountTokenOut` or `amountTokenIn`.
