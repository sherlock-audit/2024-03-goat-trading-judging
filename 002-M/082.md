# anybody can withdraw Liqidity Provider rewards by calling withdrawFees()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L616-L626
## Summary
withdrawFees() is used to withdraw rewards accrued from a liquiduiy provider, but this can withdrawn by any user
## Vulnerability Detail
withdrawFees() takes two input parameters  the token address and the LP(to) address. the to address is the address of the liquidity provider that has accrued rewards, any user can make away with a LP by calling  withdrawFees() and  input the Lp address because it has no access control and there is no storage that vets the msg.sender is the legitimate owner of the rewards in either  the GoatRouterV1  or  Goatv1pair contract when  pair.withdrawFees(to) is called
## Impact
high as anybody can runaway with rewards intended for Liquidiy providers only
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function withdrawFees(address token, address to) external nonReentrant {
        if (to == address(0)) {
            revert GoatErrors.ZeroAddress();
        }
        GoatV1Pair pair = GoatV1Pair(GoatV1Factory(FACTORY).getPool(token));

        if (address(pair) == address(0)) {
            revert GoatErrors.GoatPoolDoesNotExist();
        }
        pair.withdrawFees(to);
    }

   function withdrawFees(address to) external {
        uint256 totalFees = _earned(to, feesPerTokenStored);

        if (totalFees != 0) {
            feesPerTokenPaid[to] = feesPerTokenStored;
            lpFees[to] = 0;
            _pendingLiquidityFees -= uint112(totalFees);
            IERC20(_weth).safeTransfer(to, totalFees);
        }
        // is there a need to check if weth balance is in sync with reserve and fees?
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
access control and correct validation mechanisms should be implemented to ensure that fees can only be withdrawn from the correct liquidity provider
