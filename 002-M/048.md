# GoatV1Pair#_beforeTokenTransfer does not check that from and to may be the same, allowing any user to earn rewards for free

## Summary

`GoatV1Pair#_beforeTokenTransfer` will be called before each transfer of lptoken. At the end of the `GoatV1Pair#_beforeTokenTransfer`, `_updateFeeRewards` will be called to update fee rewards for both sender and receiver. 
There is no check for `sender` and `receiver` before calling `_updateFeeRewards`, allowing the attacker to get the rewards for free by transferring lptoken to himself.

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `_beforeTokenTransfer`, there is no check for from and to.

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal override {
        GoatTypes.InitialLPInfo memory lpInfo = _initialLPInfo;
        if (to == lpInfo.liquidityProvider) revert GoatErrors.TransferToInitialLpRestricted();
        uint256 timestamp = block.timestamp;
        ...
    }
```

At the end of the function, `_updateFeeRewards` is called for update fee rewards for both sender and receiver.

```solidity
        // Update fee rewards for both sender and receiver
        _updateFeeRewards(from);
        if (to != address(this)) {
            _updateFeeRewards(to);
        }
```

When calling `_updateFeeRewards`, `lpFees[lp]` will be updated, as shown below

```solidity
    function _updateFeeRewards(address lp) internal {
        // save for multiple reads
        uint256 _feesPerTokenStored = feesPerTokenStored;
        lpFees[lp] = _earned(lp, _feesPerTokenStored);
        feesPerTokenPaid[lp] = _feesPerTokenStored;
    }

    function _earned(address lp, uint256 _feesPerTokenStored) internal view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 feesPerToken = _feesPerTokenStored - feesPerTokenPaid[lp];
        uint256 feesAccrued = (balanceOf(lp) * feesPerToken) / 1e18;
        return lpFees[lp] + feesAccrued;
    }
```

The attacker can simply call `pair.transfer(msg.sender, 1e18);` to get the rewards for free.

## Impact

Account can update fee rewards for free, just transfer the lptoken to himself,

## Recommendation

Since transferring money to yourself is pointless, this behavior should be banned.

The fix is simple: `if (from == to) revert revert GoatErrors.ActionNotAllowed();`
