# Reentrancy in burn function, as it doesn't update the state of liquidity provider and the provider can reenter through a malicious contract.

## Summary

Reentrancy in the `GoatV1Pair::burn` function, as it doesn't update the state of liquidity provider and the provider can reenter through a malicuous contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

 In the `GoatV1Pair::burn` function, the state of the contract is updated after external calls in the contract, malicious users can reenter through a malicious contract and get all the money associated with the protocol.
As it doesn't follow CEI, here we don't update the liquidity of the liquidity provider and we update the balance of the contract after external calls, causing reentrancy in the function and getting all the money.

## Impact

Reentrancy in the function and loss of funds.


## Code Snippet

Following code snippet doesn't follow CEI:
`
        IERC20(_weth).safeTransfer(to, amountWeth);
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(to, amountToken);
        uint256 balanceEth = IERC20(_weth).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

        _update(balanceEth, balanceToken, true);`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Follows CEI and update the balances and liquidity of liquidity provider.
