# Lack of Minimum Threshold Check in setFeeToTreasury Function

## Summary
The provided code snippet shows a function setFeeToTreasury which allows the treasury to set the minimum collectible fees without enforcing a check to ensure it is greater than the predefined minimum threshold of 0.1 ether.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the setFeeToTreasury function, which does not verify whether the new value for minimumCollectableFees is greater than the predefined minimum threshold of 0.1 ether. This lack of validation could potentially allow the treasury to set fees lower than the intended minimum, leading to under-collection of fees.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability could result in under-collection of fees, potentially affecting the revenue generated by the protocol. It may also disrupt the economic incentives and balance within the ecosystem.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L80
```javascript
   function setFeeToTreasury(uint256 _minimumCollectibleFees) external {
        if (msg.sender != treasury) {
            revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
        }
        minimumCollectableFees = _minimumCollectibleFees;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add a validation check in the setFeeToTreasury function to ensure that the new value for minimumCollectableFees is greater than or equal to the predefined minimum threshold of 0.1 ether. This will help maintain the integrity of fee collection and prevent potential revenue loss for the protocol
