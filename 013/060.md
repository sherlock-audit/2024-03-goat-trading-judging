# missing zero address transfer check.

## Summary

Burn function missing check to ensure the recipient address (to) is not the zero address (0).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L209-L210

## Vulnerability Detail

The burn function utilizes safeTransfer from the ERC-20 standard to transfer WETH and _token to the user specified by the to address. However, the function lacks an explicit check to ensure to is not the zero address(0), which could lead to user lose his funds.

## Impact
user could lose his funds. a user might use a contract to call burn function and if he passed zero address (this could happen) he will lose his funds.

## Code Snippet

```solidity 
    function burn(address to) external returns(uint256 amountWeth, uint256 amountToken) {
        uint256 liquidity = balanceOf(address(this));

        // initial lp can bypass this check by using different
        // to address so _lastPoolTokenSender is used
        if (_vestingUntil == _MAX_UINT32) revert GoatErrors.PresalePeriod();

        uint256 totalSupply_ = totalSupply();
        amountWeth = (liquidity * _reserveEth) / totalSupply_;
        amountToken = (liquidity * _reserveToken) / totalSupply_;
        if (amountWeth == 0 || amountToken == 0) {
            revert GoatErrors.InsufficientLiquidityBurned();
        }

        _updateFeeRewards(to);
        _burn(address(this), liquidity);

        // Transfer liquidity tokens to the user
        // @audit missing zero check address for to.
        IERC20(_weth).safeTransfer(to, amountWeth);
        IERC20(_token).safeTransfer(to, amountToken);


        uint256 balanceEth = IERC20(_weth).balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

        _update(balanceEth, balanceToken, true);
        emit Burn(msg.sender, amountWeth, amountToken, to);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

add this line to check that to is not zero address.
if (to == address(0)) revert GoatErrors.InvalidTransferAddress();
