# [M-1] `GoatV1Factory::createPair` when emitting the event PairCreated the arguments are passed incorrectly

## Summary

Incorrect passed event arguments 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `GoatV1Factory` contract the function `createPair` emits the event `PairCreated` which takes the following parameters: weth, token, pair (in this order). However, they are passed incorrectly - token, weth, pair.

## Impact

This may cause one of these cases:

1. Lead to inconsistencies in the data stored on the blockchain. This could result in incorrect information being displayed to users or other smart contracts relying on this data.
2. lead to misinterpretation of events by other smart contracts or off-chain applications monitoring the blockchain. This can result in unexpected behavior or incorrect decision-making based on these events.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Simply reorder the event parameters:

```diff
- emit PairCreated(token, weth, address(pair));
+ emit PairCreated(weth, token, address(pair));
```
