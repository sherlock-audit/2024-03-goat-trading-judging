# Unable to Burn LP Token When Pool is Imbalanced

## Summary
The burning of small liquidity will be revert

## Vulnerability Detail

The function burn() requires that the output amount of both tokens be greater than 0. If the pool is extremely imbalanced, the rounding-down calculation could result in one of the amounts equaling 0, causing a burn() revert.

## Impact

There are two potential outcomes:

Users must burn a larger amount to make it valid, meaning they must deposit more into the pool.
Users must swap to make the pool less imbalanced.
In both cases, users experience a loss. However, if they do nothing, they cannot burn their LP token.

## Code Snippet

```javascript
uint256 totalSupply_ = totalSupply();
amountWeth = (liquidity * _reserveEth) / totalSupply_;
amountToken = (liquidity * _reserveToken) / totalSupply_;
if (amountWeth == 0 || amountToken == 0) {
    revert GoatErrors.InsufficientLiquidityBurned();
}
```

## Recommendation

Change OR logic to AND logic.

```javascript
 if (amountWeth == 0 && amountToken == 0) { revert GoatErrors.InsufficientLiquidityBurned(); }
```
