# a liquidity provider can grief LP's users rewards

## Summary

any liquidity provider with a significant portion of LP tokens can grief other LP's rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

in this protocol rewards are accrued in the variable `feesPerTokenStored` which contains the amount of fees for each lpToken, for users not to get fees of swaps done before they were LP's the mapping `feesPerTokenPaid[lp]` holds the `feesPerTokenStored` of the time they claimed rewards or changed their balance of lp's. 
for transfers this happens in `_beforeTokenTransfer` in 
```solidity
_updateFeeRewards(from);
        if (to != address(this)) {
            _updateFeeRewards(to);
        }
```

but this happens for everybody except the  pair itself.
so a LP can claim his rewards then transfer to the pair and call 
```solidity
function withdrawFees(address to) external {
        uint256 totalFees = _earned(to, feesPerTokenStored);

        if (totalFees != 0) {
            feesPerTokenPaid[to] = feesPerTokenStored;
            lpFees[to] = 0;
            _pendingLiquidityFees -= uint112(totalFees);
            IERC20(_weth).safeTransfer(to, totalFees);
        }
        // is there a need to check if weth balance is in sync with reserve and fees?
    }
```

which will get rewards again for the same amount of lp tokens.
## Impact

any lp can grief rewards for other lp's
