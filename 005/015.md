# Malicious liquidity provider can continously withdraw fee frpm the pool

## Summary
The GoatV1Pair.sol::withdrawFee is a function set up so liquidity provider can withdraw the profit of pool trades allocated to them, however due to the use of balanceOf() and not tracking the address of claimer a malicious liquidity provider can withdraw fees multiple times draining the _pendingLiquidityFee at the expense of other liquidity providers

## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious liquidity provider can withdraw fee multiple times by transferring his lp token to different wallet and calling the GoatV1Pair.sol::withdrawFee across different wallet.

The withdrawFee function is the function to be called by liquidity provider to claim their fee allocation with the address of the liquidity provider passed in as the argument.

This then calculate the total fees in this line of code

But as seen in the _earned function, the feeAccrued depends on the token balance of the user for its calculation, this process is manipulatable as user can have other LPs send him tokens to boost his fee accrued to withdraw more fee

Then the final process of withdrawal is completed, but malicious LP can leverage the use of to argument and balanceOf by sending his LP token to a different wallet and then call the withdrawFee again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a state (mapping) to track each LP address alongside the amount of claimable fee, so LPs won't be able to claim multiple times
