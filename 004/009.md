# `swapExactTokensForWeth` in `GoatRouterV1` will fail if token is fee-on-transfer.

## Summary
`swapExactTokensForWeth` in `GoatRouterV1` will fail if token is fee-on-transfer. 
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
In the `GoatV1Pair.sol` smart contract, the process of `swapExactTokensForWeth` involves calculating `amountWethOut` precisely using `getWethAmountOutAmm` or `getWethAmountOutPresale` with argument `amountIn`. Then it will safeTransferFrom `amountIn` token to pair.
```solidity
IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pair), amountIn);
pair.swap(0, amountWethOut, to);
``` 
However, the amount of token pair receives is less than amountIn, which means it won't be satisfied for Constant product, then it will be revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should transfer what pair received actually. The solution should involve adjusting the transfer to account for the actual received amount post-fee deductions.
