# `removeLiquidityETH` will fail in `GoatRouterV1.sol` if token is fee-on-transfer.

## Summary
`removeLiquidityETH` will fail in `GoatRouterV1.sol` if token is fee-on-transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within GoatRouterV1.sol, the variable `amountToken` represents the return value from `removeLiquidity`. However, this figure does not accurately reflect the amount GoatRouterV1 actually receives due to the discrepancy caused by fee-on-transfer tokens. The relevant code snippet demonstrates the issue:
```solidity
function removeLiquidityETH(
        address token,
        uint256 liquidity,
        uint256 tokenMin,
        uint256 ethMin,
        address to,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external ensure(deadline) returns (uint256 amountWeth, uint256 amountToken) {
        (amountWeth, amountToken) = removeLiquidity(token, liquidity, tokenMin, ethMin, address(this), deadline);
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(to, amountToken);
        IWETH(WETH).withdraw(amountWeth);
        (bool success,) = to.call{value: amountWeth}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert GoatErrors.EthTransferFailed();
        }
    }
```
What `GoatRouterV1` received is `amountToken - fee`. Consequently, `GoatRouterV1` lacks sufficient tokens for the intended transfer, leading to transaction failure.

## Impact
The removeLiquidityETH function in GoatRouterV1.sol is prone to failure when interacting with fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should transfer what it received. The solution should involve adjusting the transfer to account for the actual received amount post-fee deductions.
