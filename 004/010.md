# `addLiquidityETH` in `GoatRouterV1.sol` will fail when providing initial liquidity if token is fee-on-transfer.

## Summary
`addLiquidityETH` in `GoatRouterV1.sol` will fail when providing initial liquidity if token is fee-on-transfer.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `GoatV1Pair.sol` smart contract, the process for providing initial liquidity involves a stringent requirement on the `balanceToken`. The code snippet below illustrates the condition that must be met:
```solitity
if (balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)) {
                    revert GoatErrors.InsufficientTokenAmount();
}
```
In the `addLiquidityETH` function of `GoatRouterV1.sol`, the system precisely calculates the amount of the token and transfers it to the pool:
```solitity
GoatTypes.LocalVariables_AddLiquidity memory vars = _ensurePoolAndPrepareLiqudityParameters(
            token, tokenDesired, wethDesired, tokenMin, wethMin, initParams, false
        );

IERC20(vars.token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, vars.pair, vars.actualTokenAmount);
```
However, this implementation does not account for tokens that are fee-on-transfer. As a result, the token pair ends up receiving less than `vars.actualTokenAmount`, leading to a transaction revert, because `balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm`
## Impact
The `addLiquidityETH` function in `GoatRouterV1.sol` fails during the initial liquidity provision if the involved token implements a fee-on-transfer mechanism. This issue can significantly hinder liquidity addition to the protocol by `GoatRouterV1`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is recommended to adjust the logic to account for the transfer fee by transferring a higher amount of the token. This adjustment ensures that the received amount post-fee deduction aligns with the actualTokenAmount required for liquidity provision, thereby preventing transaction revert.
