# Front-running Vulnerability through Slippage Tolerance

## Summary
Miners can exploit low slippage tolerance in swaps by manipulating market price slightly, potentially leading to failed swaps or users receiving less than desired.
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
       function swapWethForExactTokens(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, address token, address to, uint256 deadline)
        external
        ensure(deadline)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amountTokenOut)
        //amountOutmin=minimum amount of token to be received aka slippage
    {
        GoatV1Pair pair;
        (amountTokenOut, pair) = _getAmountTokenOut(amountIn, amountOutMin, token);
        IERC20(WETH).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pair), amountIn);
        pair.swap(amountTokenOut, ZERO, to);//using swap function here
    }
```
## Impact
- Loss of user's funds.
-  Gas griefing
- Failed txns could lead to bad reputation of protocol amon traders.
## Code Snippet
Here I have written a **POC** scenario to demonstrate a miner attack on swap function `swapWethForExactTokens`

```solidity
   function swapWethForExactTokens(uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOutMin, address token, address to, uint256 deadline)
        external
        ensure(deadline)
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amountTokenOut)
        //amountOutmin=minimum amount of token to be received aka slippage
    {
        GoatV1Pair pair;
        (amountTokenOut, pair) = _getAmountTokenOut(amountIn, amountOutMin, token);
        IERC20(WETH).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(pair), amountIn);
        pair.swap(amountTokenOut, ZERO, to);//using swap function here
    }
```

- Alice wants to swap 1 ETH (wrapped in WETH) for a specific token (let's call it TOKEN) .
- In return, Alice ideally wants to receive at least 100 TOKEN in return for her 1 ETH.
- However, Alice understands prices can fluctuate during the swap. To account for this, she sets a minimum acceptable output amount (amountOutMin) of 95 TOKEN (5% slippage tolerance).
- Bob, a miner on the network, sees Alice's transaction. He notices the desired output (100 TOKEN) and the minimum acceptable amount (95 TOKEN).

- Bob sees an opportunity because the slippage tolerance is relatively low. He decides to manipulate the market price slightly before Alice's swap executes:

- Current Market Price: The current market price is 1 ETH = 102 TOKEN (before Bob's manipulation).
- Bob quickly executes a small market buy order for 0.01 ETH of the TOKEN. This creates a temporary price increase.
- New Market Price: Due to Bob's buy order, the new market price becomes:

1 ETH = 101.96 TOKEN (approximately 0.04% increase).

Impact on Alice:

- Transaction Reverts: With the new price, Alice wouldn't receive her desired 100 TOKEN . She would only get:
>1 ETH / 101.96 TOKEN/ETH ≈ 98.04 TOKEN
>After slippage(5%) it will be around ≈93.138 TOKEN
This falls below her minimum acceptable amount (95 TOKEN), so the transaction reverts.

Consequences for Alice:

>**Failed Swap:** Alice's swap fails due to the manipulated price and her tight slippage tolerance.
>**Gas Fees:** Alice loses the gas fees spent on the failed transaction.
>**Missed Opportunity:** Depending on market movements, Alice might miss out on a favorable swap price.

**Bob's Potential Gain:**

**Profit (Optional):** In this scenario, Bob's profit depends on his ability to sell his purchased 0.01 ETH of TOKEN quickly after the price manipulation.
