# Sending Ethers  to GoatV1Pair contract before creating can cause possible DOS attack - Medium

## Summary
By sending more weth than bootstrapEth amount to GoatV1Pair contract before contract creation can cause the pair contract creation failure.
## Vulnerability Detail
During token pair creating process where initial liquidities are minted,  a requirement is made where the initial weth balance can not surpass the bootstrapEth (GoatV1Pair:mint, line:131:132). However, balanceEth can be increased passing the bootstrapEth since balanceEth is the balance of the GoatV1Pair contract, and the balance can be changed by sending weth to its address before the pair contract is created. Note that the pair contract is created in "GoatV1Factory(FACTORY).createPair(token, initParams)" by "new GoatV1Pair()"  as its address can be precaculated.
## Impact
Medium
## Code Snippet
```
 if (balanceEth > mintVars.bootstrapEth) {
  revert GoatErrors.SupplyMoreThanBootstrapEth();
            }
```
where
```
uint256 balanceEth = IERC20(_weth).balanceOf(address(this));
```
