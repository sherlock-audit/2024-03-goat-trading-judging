# A Denial-of-Service (DOS) attack may occur due to a check on the WETH balance in the mint function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L131C14-L133C14

## Summary

when minting tokens in `GoatV1Pair.sol`, if the WETH balance surpasses `mintVars.bootstrapEth`, transactions are reverted. This balance can increase via WETH transfers to the pair contract. This vulnerability enables an attacker to execute a DOS or griefing attack by sending the contract WETH tokens, resulting in transaction reversals.

## Vulnerability Detail

During the presale phase of the `GoatV1Pair.sol` token pair contract in the `function mint(address to) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 liquidity)`, denoted by `_vestingUntil == _MAX_UINT32`, if the balance of Wrapped Ether (WETH) exceeds the value specified by `mintVars.bootstrapEth`, the pair contract will revert transactions.

The balanceEth variable represents the WETH balance of the pair contract, obtained through `IERC20(_weth).balanceOf(address(this))`. This balance can be augmented by transferring WETH tokens to the pair contract. Therefore, an attacker could potentially execute a Denial-of-Service (DOS) or griefing attack by flooding the contract with WETH tokens, causing the contract to revert transactions.


## Impact
this essentially allows an attacker to prevent anybody from calling the mint function

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider storing the `WETH` balance as a variable on the contract
