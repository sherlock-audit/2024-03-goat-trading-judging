# Griefing Attack by Front-Running During Initial Liquidity Provision

## Summary
A potential front-running vulnerability exists in the `GoatV1Pair` contract during the initial liquidity provision process, where an attacker can disrupt the minting by sending a small amount of WETH or tokens to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint()` function in the `GoatV1Pair` contract strictly enforces that the ETH and token balances match the expected bootstrap values for the initial liquidity event. If an attacker sends 1 wei of WETH or tokens to the contract just before the first mint transaction is executed, it could cause the transaction to fail due to balance checks.

## Impact
- Exceeding `_bootstrapEth` by 1 wei could revert the transaction with `GoatErrors.SupplyMoreThanBootstrapEth()`.
- A token balance 1 wei higher than expected could revert the transaction with `GoatErrors.InsufficientTokenAmount()`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Permit an amount slightly above the required threshold and issue a refund of the surplus to the sender.
