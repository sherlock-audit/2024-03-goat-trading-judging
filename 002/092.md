# potential DOS attack because of strict check on `balanceToken`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L139C1-L140C65

## Summary
when minting tokens in `GoatV1Pair.sol`, if `balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)`, transactions are reverted. This balance can increase via token transfers to the pair contract. This vulnerability enables an attacker to execute a DOS or griefing attack by sending the contract tokens, resulting in transaction reversals.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
this essentially allows an attacker to prevent anybody from successfully executing the mint function

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider using a less strict check like `!=`
