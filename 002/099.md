# Potential DOS

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L33

## Summary
Potential DoS attack on the `GoatV1Pair::createPair` 

## Vulnerability Detail
A vulnerability exists whereby a malicious user can exploit the GoatV1Pair::createPair function by inputting low numerical values greater than zero but less than 4. Following a sequence of code execution, the initialize function within the GoatV1Pair contract is triggered. Within this function, _initialTokenMatch and _virtualEth are assigned the values of params.virtualEth and params.bootstrapEth respectively. Subsequently, when the mint function is invoked in the GoatV1Pair contract, mintVars.virtualEth and mintVars.initialTokenMatch are initialized with the values of _virtualEth and _initialTokenMatch. However, a flaw arises within the mint function where liquidity is calculated using the formula:
```solidity
liquidity =  Math.sqrt(uint256(mintVars.virtualEth) * uint256(mintVars.initialTokenMatch)) - MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY;

```
