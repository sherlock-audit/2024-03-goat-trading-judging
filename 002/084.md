# Sending token before GoatV1Pai contract creating can cause possible DOS attack - Medium

## Summary
By sending small number of tokens to GoatV1Pair contract before its creating can cause the pair contract creation failure.
## Vulnerability Detail
Token pair contract is created during the first liquidity adding. When minting initialize liquidity  in GoatV1Pair::mint, a requirement is made as (balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)). However balanceToken  can be easily increased by sending token to the pair address which can be precaculated. This will break the equivalence which can cause the pair contract creating and initial addliquidity failing.
## Impact
Medium
## Code Snippet
```
if (balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)) {
 revert GoatErrors.InsufficientTokenAmount();
                }
```
where 
```
uint256 balanceToken = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
```
