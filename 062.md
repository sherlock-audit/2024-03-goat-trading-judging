# GoatV1Pair.sol#mint can be easily broken

## Summary
balanceOf is used for `balanceEth` which is easy to manipulate.

## Vulnerability Detail
A pool can be converted to AMM when the `bootstrapEth` is equal to the `balanceEth` in the contract. If `balanceEth < mintVars.bootstrapEth` liquidity will be added to the pool, but if  `balanceEth > mintVars.bootstrapEth` the function will revert.

The problem is balanceOf is used for `balanceEth` which gets the amount in the contract and is easy to manipulate.
```js 
uint256 balanceEth = IERC20(_weth).balanceOf(address(this));
```

A malicious user can front run the transaction that is going to make the pool AMM (meaning `bootstrapEth == balanceEth`) and sent 1 wei to the contract to increase its balance. That would make this and every other transaction to revert because `balanceEth > mintVars.bootstrapEth`. 

## Impact
A malicious user can break mint functionality for pools.
