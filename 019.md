# Lack Control access of the `GoatV1Pair.sol#takeOverPool()` function.

## Summary
Due to the lack of control access to the `GoatV1Pair.sol#takeOverPool()` function, an attacker can take over the pool from a trusted initilal LP and set unfavorable initial conditions to grief the pool.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `GoatV1Pair.sol#takeOverPool()` function is used to allow a team to take over a pool from a malicious actor and prevent malicious actors from griefing the pool by setting unfavorable initial conditions.
However, an arbitrary user can take over the pool due to weak access control of the `GoatV1Pair.sol#takeOverPool()` function.
As a result, an attacker can take over the pool from a trusted initilal LP and set unfavorable initial conditions to grief the pool.
## Impact
An attacker can take over the pool from a trusted initilal LP and set unfavorable initial conditions to the pool.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following line to the `GoatV1Pair.sol#takeOverPool()` function to allow a trusted team to take over the pool.

        ...SNIP
    }
