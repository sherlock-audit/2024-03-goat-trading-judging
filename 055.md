# Fee on transfer tokens are not supported by protocol functions

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens are not supported by protocol functions

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens have a fee on transfer, for example USDT. Usually such fee is not enabled but could be re-enabled at any time. With this fee enabled the functions interacting with Fee on transfer tokens would receive slightly less tokens than the amounts requested.

The readme states, Fee on transfer tokens will be used by protocol,
> Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
Yes.

and Protocol is expected to be used with any ERC20 token.
> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?
Any ERC20 tokens should be able to be used. We are not concerned with problems brought about by token blocklist

Some ERC20 tokens(e.g. STA,PAXG, USDC,USDT) allow for charging a fee any time transfer()or transferFrom() is called. This reference can be checked [here](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer)

Some of affected functions which do not support Fee on transfer tokens include,
1) `GoatRouterV1.swapExactETHForTokens()`
2) `GoatRouterV1.swapExactTokensForWeth()`
3) ERC20 tokens using safeTranfer() and safeTransferFrom() in inscope contract functions where Fee on transfer tokens are expected to be used and all such functions are affected by this issue.

## Impact
Tokens with a fee on transfer is not supported which can cause accounting errors. The end user or protocol might receive less tokens than expected. Function with strict checks can fail if fee is enabled on FOT tokens.

This issue is identified as Medium severity as it breaks one of the core functionality of protocol where FOT tokens are expected to be used and above issue will be happened due to not support of FOT.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the balanceOf() tokens before and after a safeTransfer() or safeTransferFrom(). Use the difference as the amount of tokens sent/received.
