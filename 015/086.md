# Potential Liquidity Depletion in Swap Function Due to inadequate Conditional Check

## Summary
The swap() function permits scenarios where one token's liquidity can be entirely depleted from the pool due to an inadequate conditional check that fails to prevent the liquidity reserves from being completely drained.

## Vulnerability Detail
The swap() function's conditional check is not robust enough to prevent the total depletion of a token's liquidity from the pool. It allows transactions where the output amount (amountTokenOut or amountWethOut) is equal to the token's reserve, which could lead to a state where the pool has zero liquidity for that token.

```javascript
(swapVars.initialReserveEth, swapVars.initialReserveToken) = _getActualReserves();
        if (amountTokenOut > swapVars.initialReserveToken || amountWethOut > swapVars.initialReserveEth) {
            revert GoatErrors.InsufficientAmountOut();
        }
```


## Impact
Protocol does not have any reserves since they are swapped out by a user

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rewrite the if statement to following:
```javascript
if (amountTokenOut >= swapVars.initialReserveToken || amountWethOut >= swapVars.initialReserveEth) {
            revert GoatErrors.InsufficientAmountOut();
        }
```
