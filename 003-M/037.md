# Malicious initial liquidity provider may be able to prevent GoatV1Pair take overs

## Summary
Malicious initial liquidity provider may be able to prevent pool take overs.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `takeOverPool` mechanism allows anyone who can provide 110% of the `ETH` and `token` balance a `Goatv1Pair` presale that has not reached the goal `bootstrapETH` amount after 30 days. During a take over the initial `liquidityProvider` is refunded their eth (as `WETH`) and the pair ERC-20 `token` amount they deposited. If the `token` is an ERC-777 token (`ERC777Receiver` callback) or has some type of callback that executes during token transfers a malicious initial `liquidityProvider` can force token transfers to fail causing the pool take over to fail.

## Impact

```solidity
function _handleTakeoverTransfers(IERC20 weth, IERC20 token, address lp, uint256 wethAmount, uint256 tokenAmount)
        internal
    {
        if (wethAmount != 0) {
            // Malicious frontrunners can create cheaper pools buy tokens cheap
            // and make it costly for the teams to take over. So, we need to have penalty
            // for the frontrunner.
            uint256 penalty = (wethAmount * 5) / 100;
            // actual amount to transfer
            wethAmount -= penalty;
            weth.safeTransfer(lp, wethAmount);
            weth.safeTransfer(IGoatV1Factory(factory).treasury(), penalty);
        }
        token.safeTransfer(lp, tokenAmount);
    }
```
If a malicious lp can force `token.safeTransfer(lp, tokenAmount);` to always fail during a `takeOver` then they could gain permanent control on the pool.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One approach to prevent this from occurring is to introduce a claiming mechanism for the initial lp to regain their tokens after a takeover. This would prevent the `takeOver` call from having to send tokens back to the lp within the same transaction.

Another approach would be to not support ERC-20 tokens that support arbitrary `onReceive()` callbacks
