# Title: Lack of Allowance Validation in ERC20 Token Contract's transferFrom Function

## Summary
An ERC20 token transfer mechanism with two functions: transferFrom and approve. The concern raised is regarding the lack of validation in the transferFrom function, which allows the spender to potentially spend more tokens than the approved allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the transferFrom function, where it doesn't verify if the spender (msg.sender) is allowed to transfer the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the owner _from. Instead, it only checks if the allowance is not equal to the maximum value of uint256.


## Impact
This vulnerability allows the spender to potentially spend more tokens than what has been approved by the owner, leading to unauthorized token transfers and potential loss for the owner.

## Code Snippet
**https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1ERC20.sol#L75**
```javascript 
  function transferFrom(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _value
    ) public returns (bool success) {
        if (_allowances[_from][msg.sender] != type(uint256).max) {
            _allowances[_from][msg.sender] -= _value;
        }
        _transfer(_from, _to, _value);
        return true;
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It's recommended to add validation in the transferFrom function to ensure that the spender cannot spend more tokens than the approved allowance. This can be done by comparing _value with the allowance before executing the transfer.
