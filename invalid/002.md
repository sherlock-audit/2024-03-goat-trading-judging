# `name()` is not a part of the ERC-20 standard

## Summary
> ### Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? 
Any ERC20 tokens should be able to be used. We are not concerned with problems brought about by token blocklists.
## Vulnerability Detail
`name()` is not a part of the ERC-20 standard and due to it, the `GoatV1Pair#initialize` will revert for some tokens that don't have the `name()` function in their implementations:
```solidity
function initialize(address token, address weth, string memory baseName, GoatTypes.InitParams memory params)
        external
    {
        if (msg.sender != factory) revert GoatErrors.GoatV1Forbidden();
        _token = token;
        _weth = weth;
        // setting non zero value so that swap will not incur new storage write on update
        _vestingUntil = _MAX_UINT32;
        // Is there a token without a name that may result in revert in this case?
@>        string memory tokenName = IERC20Metadata(_token).name();
```
## Impact
New pairs can not be created and initialized for some tokens.
