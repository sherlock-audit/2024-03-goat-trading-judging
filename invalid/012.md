# [M-1] Reversion Due to Address Zero in `GoatV1Factory.createPair` Function which could lead to a potential DoS

## Summary
A medium severity vulnerability was discovered in the `GoatV1Factory` contract's `createPair` function, where omission of a zero address (`address(0)`) check for the token parameter can lead to transaction reversion. This issue indirectly affects the `GoatV1Pair.initialize` function, potentially resulting in a denial of service (DoS) vulnerability by preventing new pair creation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a validation check against the zero address in the `createPair` function allows for the possibility of passing `address(0)` as a token address. This results in a failed attempt to retrieve the token's name in the `GoatV1Pair.initialize` function, leading to a revert due to `address(0)` not being a valid ERC-20 token. This oversight bypasses the intended functionality of safely creating new token pairs.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial of service (DoS), where legitimate users are barred from creating new pairs, potentially stalling the platform's operations. It opens up avenues for disruption attacks, particularly if integrated with other contract functionalities.

## Code Snippet
Affected code segments:
- GoatV1Factory contract's `createPair` function: [GoatV1Factory.sol#L33-L49](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L33-L49)
- GoatV1Pair contract's `initialize` function: [GoatV1Pair.sol#L79-L88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L79-L88)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
A test case demonstrating the vulnerability through an expected revert when attempting to create a pair with the zero address is as follows:
```solidity
// Add this test to GoatV1Factory.t.sol.
function testCreatePairWithZeroAddressReverts() public {
    GoatTypes.InitParams memory initParams = GoatTypes.InitParams(10e18, 10e18, 0, 1000e18);
    vm.expectRevert();
    factory.createPair(address(0), initParams);
}
```
Output shows successful identification of the revert, validating the vulnerability's presence.
```solidity
[PASS] testCreatePairWithZeroAddressReverts() (gas: 3207291)

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability and avert potential DoS attacks, the following code adjustment is recommended for the `GoatV1Factory.createPair` function:
```diff
function createPair(address token, GoatTypes.InitParams memory params) external returns (address) {
+   if (token == address(0)) revert GoatErrors.InvalidTokenAddress(); // Prevent zero address
    if (params.bootstrapEth == 0 || params.virtualEth == 0 || params.initialTokenMatch == 0) {
        revert GoatErrors.InvalidParams();
    }
    if (pools[token] != address(0)) {
        revert GoatErrors.PairExists();
    }
    if (token == weth) {
        revert GoatErrors.CannotPairWithBaseAsset();
    }
    GoatV1Pair pair = new GoatV1Pair();
    pair.initialize(token, weth, baseName, params);
    pools[token] = address(pair);
    emit PairCreated(token, weth, address(pair));
    return address(pair);
}
```
This addition ensures that `address(0)` is explicitly disallowed as a valid token address, thereby enhancing the contract's security and operational integrity.
