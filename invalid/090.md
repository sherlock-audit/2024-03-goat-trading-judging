# single point of failure.

## Summary

using a single address for critical functions it could damage the protocol.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L30

## Vulnerability Detail

the treasury address has so much power it can change minimumCollectableFees and it can accept weth from GoatV1Pair.sol [weth.safeTransfer(IGoatV1Factory(factory).treasury(), penalty);](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L602) if the treasury address is compromised the attacker can daamge the protocol.

the treasury address can change minimumCollectableFees this would be very dangerous.

```solidity 
    function setFeeToTreasury(uint256 _minimumCollectibleFees) external {
        if (msg.sender != treasury) {
            revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
        }
        minimumCollectableFees = _minimumCollectibleFees;
    }
```

## Impact

the protocol could be damaged if the treasury address is compromised.
