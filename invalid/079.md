# `GoatV1Pair` may never enter pre-sale period due to DoS

## Summary
An attacker could send 1 wei of tokens to the pair before first minting, preventing the pair to enter in pre-sale mode because of a strict balance of tokens condition.
## Vulnerability Detail
On the first call to `GoatV1Pair::mint` when a team wants to start the pre-sale mode, meaning that `_vestingUntil == _MAX_UINT32` and `balanceEth < mintVars.bootstrapEth`, a strict check on the balance of tokens in the pair is done:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/beb09519ad0c0ec0fdf5b96060fe5e4aafd71cff/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L139-L141
```solidity
        if (balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)) {
            revert GoatErrors.InsufficientTokenAmount();
        }
```
The transaction will revert even if the difference is of 1 wei which creates a cheap scenario for DoS. Additionally, as `(tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)` are values calculated from internal pair variables, the solution to this won't be just entering new parameters (even if that were the case, modifying "price" parameters modifying teams plans won't be expected behavior).
## Impact
`GoatV1Pair`'s may never enter in pre-sale period.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a less strict check on token balance:
```diff
-       if (balanceToken != (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)) {
+       if (balanceToken < (tokenAmtForPresale + tokenAmtForAmm)) {
            revert GoatErrors.InsufficientTokenAmount();
        }
```

If the system needs that strict equality, consider sending surplus tokens to a trusted address or burning them.
