# Approval race condition:

## Summary
  Front running attack in approve
## Vulnerability Detail
   function _approve(address _owner, address _spender, uint256 _value) internal {
        _allowances[_owner][_spender] = _value;
        emit Approval(_owner, _spender, _value);
    }
## Impact
The contract of the  GoatV1ERC20    not have any protection against the well-known “Multiple Withdrawal Attack” attack on the Approve/TransferFrom methods of the ERC20 standard.


There are solutions to mitigate this front running such as, to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards; another solution could the one that Open Zeppelin offers, where the non-standard decreaseAllowance and increaseAllowance functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues involving setting allowances.
