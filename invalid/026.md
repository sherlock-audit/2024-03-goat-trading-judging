# Zero Address Exploit: Unauthorized Modification of Minimum Fee in GoatV1Factory

## Summary
There is three functions acceptTreasury() setTreasury() and setFeeToTreasury() in GoatV1Factory.sol. Here setTreasury is only called by the treasury for setting the address of pendingTreasury and acceptTreasury is called by the pendingTreasury for setting the pending treasury to address(0) and and update the treasury address to msg.sender. The setFeeToTreasury() function is used to set  the  minimumCollectableFees .
## Vulnerability Detail
The bug occur if an attacker call acceptTreasury() before the treasury set the pendingTreasury in setTreasury() and now anyone can call the Factory :: setFeeToTreasury()  using address(0) and can set the minimumCollectableFees to any amount.
Steps to exploit :
1.I am an attacker and call the acceptTreasury() function still that I assume that pendingTreasury is not set by the Treasury.
2.Here I can use the address(0) as msg.sender for calling acceptTreasury. It will not revert because by default address of pendingTreasury is address(0).
3.Now it will set the address of pendingTreasury by address(0) and Treasury is updated by msg.sender which is address(0).
4 .Now    pendingTreasury = address(0)
               Treasury = address(0)
5. Now anyone with address(0) call the setFeeToTreasury() function and set any amout of fee using this .
## Impact
The impact is that it will destroy the core functionality of only fee is set by the treasury of the protocol.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L65-L85
**POC**
function testanyonewithzeroaddresscanchangetheTreasuryFee() public {
vm.startprank(address(0));
factory.acceptTreasury();
vm.stopPrank();
console.log("pending treasury is", factory.pendingTreasury());
console.log("treasury is", factory.treasury());
assertEq(factory.treasury(),address(0));
assertEq(factory.pendingTreasury(),address(0));
vm.startprank(address(0));
factory.setFeeToTreasury(0);
vm.stopPrank();
assertEq(factory.minimumCollectableFees() ,0);
}
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
By changing these two function like this can prevent this attack .
// @Audit : update
function setTreasury(address _pendingTreasury) external returns(bool) {
require(_pendingTreasury!=address(0) , " address(0) is not allowed" );
if (msg.sender != treasury) {
revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
}
pendingTreasury = _pendingTreasury;
return true;
}
// @Audit : update
function acceptTreasury() external {
require(setTreasury() , " The treasury is not set");
if (msg.sender != pendingTreasury) {
revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
}
pendingTreasury = address(0);
treasury = msg.sender;
}
