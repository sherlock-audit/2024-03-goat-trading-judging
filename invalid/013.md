# [M-02] Insufficient Validation for Liquidity Parameters Leading to Slippage Manipulation

## Summary
A medium severity vulnerability has been identified within the `GoatRouterV1` smart contract, specifically in the `addLiquidity` and `addLiquidityETH` functions. This vulnerability arises from insufficient validation of liquidity parameters, potentially allowing for slippage manipulation and exposing users to financial exploitation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `addLiquidity` and `addLiquidityETH` functions in the `GoatRouterV1` contract lack comprehensive validation mechanisms for input parameters against extreme slippage or price impact conditions. The absence of stringent checks allows for the possibility of adding liquidity at rates that could lead to significant price manipulation within the pools, adversely affecting market integrity and user assets.

## Impact
Exploiting this vulnerability could enable attackers to create scenarios where market prices are manipulated through the addition of liquidity in calculated amounts, causing notable slippage. Such manipulations can result in substantial financial losses for users engaging with the manipulated pools, eroding trust in the platform's ability to maintain stable and fair market conditions.

## Code Snippet
Relevant code sections in the `GoatRouterV1` contract:
- `addLiquidity` function: [GoatRouterV1.sol#L51-L75](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/periphery/GoatRouterV1.sol#L51-L75)
- `addLiquidityETH` function: [GoatRouterV1.sol#L77-L108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/periphery/GoatRouterV1.sol#L77-L108)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability and enhance the security against financial manipulation, the following code adjustments are recommended for the `GoatRouterV1` contract's liquidity functions:
```diff
function addLiquidity(...) external returns (...) {
+   // Implement validation for slippage and price impact
+   require(tokenPriceImpact <= maxAllowedPriceImpact, "Price impact exceeds limit");
+   require(slippage <= maxAllowedSlippage, "Slippage exceeds limit");
    ...
}

function addLiquidityETH(...) external payable returns (...) {
+   // Implement validation for slippage and price impact
+   require(ethPriceImpact <= maxAllowedPriceImpact, "Price impact exceeds limit");
+   require(slippage <= maxAllowedSlippage, "Slippage exceeds limit");
    ...
}
```
Introducing explicit checks for price impact and slippage within these functions will ensure that all liquidity transactions are executed within predefined risk thresholds. This proactive approach guards against price manipulation attempts, protects user assets, and reinforces the protocol's market stability.
