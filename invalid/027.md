# GoatV1Factory :: Unauthorized Modification of Treasury Ownership Using Address(0)

## Summary
There is two functions acceptTreasury() and setTreasury() in GoatV1Factory.sol. Here setTreasury is only called by the treasury for setting the address of pendingTreasury and acceptTreasury is called by the pendingTreasury for setting the pending treasury to address(0) and and update the treasury address to msg.sender.
## Vulnerability Detail
The bug occur if an attacker call acceptTreasury() before the treasury set the pendingTreasury in setTreasury().

Steps to exploit :

I am an attacker and call the acceptTreasury() function still that I assume that pendingTreasury is not set by the Treasury.
Here I can use the address(0) as msg.sender for calling acceptTreasury. It will not revert because by default address of pendingTreasury is address(0).
Now it will set the address of pendingTreasury by address(0) and Treasury is updated by msg.sender which is address(0).
Now pendingTreasury = address(0)
Treasury = address(0)
## Impact
The impact is that anyone can use the address(0) for getting the rights of Treasury .
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/main/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Factory.sol#L65-L78
**POC**
        function testzeroaddresscanchangetheTreasury() public {
        vm.startprank(address(0));
        factory.acceptTreasury();
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("pending treasury is", factory.pendingTreasury());
        console.log("treasury is", factory.treasury());
        assertEq(factory.treasury(),address(0));
        assertEq(factory.pendingTreasury(),address(0));
    }
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Its recommended to add a check in acceptTreasury which checks that either setTreasury is called or not .It the treasury is not set before this then revert the function . Write the functions like this.
   // @audit : update
    function setTreasury(address _pendingTreasury) external returns(bool) {
     require(_pendingTreasury!=address(0) , " address(0) is not allowed" );   
     if (msg.sender != treasury) {
            revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
        }
        pendingTreasury = _pendingTreasury;
        return true;
     }
    // @audit : update
    function acceptTreasury() external {
        require(setTreasury() , " The treasury is not set");
        if (msg.sender != pendingTreasury) {
            revert GoatErrors.Forbidden();
        }
        pendingTreasury = address(0);
        treasury = msg.sender;
    }
