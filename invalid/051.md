# An ineffective MEV protection mechanism can leads to price differences.

## Summary
It's very easy and cheap for someone to block one of the swap directions (buy or sell), causing a significant difference from the actual market price.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GoatRouterV1.swap` function is used for buying and selling an asset. The function includes a [MEV protection check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/beb09519ad0c0ec0fdf5b96060fe5e4aafd71cff/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L252), which allows only a specific sequence of actions within a single block.

The `_handleMevCheck` function requires that actions within a block adhere to a set order. The scenarios for allowed and disallowed actions are detailed [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-03-goat-trading/blob/beb09519ad0c0ec0fdf5b96060fe5e4aafd71cff/goat-trading/contracts/exchange/GoatV1Pair.sol#L729-L742).

Due to the design of `_handleMevCheck`, it is straightforward and cheap for anyone to insert their transaction (buy or sell) before the others in the block, thereby determining the permitted actions in that block and blocking the opposite action. 

Maintaining this disruption through `_handleMevCheck` is cheap, requiring only a transaction of 1 wei to be placed before others.

## Impact
This could lead to a DOS for several blocks and distorting the price from the actual market price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing or modifying the MEV protection mechanism, as the drawbacks seem to outweigh the benefits.
Proper use of `deadline` and `amountOutMin` parameters could offer sufficient MEV protection.
